## Overview

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to design and implement a movie recommender system that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The system employs various collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of movie suggestions.

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Utilized a movie dataset containing information about movies, genres, user ratings, and tags.
   - Explored and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
   - Visualized key patterns, such as user preferences and movie popularity, to gain insights.

3. **Content-Based Filtering:**
   - Implemented a content-based recommender system using movie genres.
   - Explored the use of TF-IDF vectors to represent movie content and calculate similarities.

4. **Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering (KNN):**
   - Implemented a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model using SciKit Learn's KNN.
   - Explored both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches.
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

5. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering (SVD):**
   - Implemented a model-based collaborative filtering approach using the Surprise library and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
   - Evaluated the model's performance and explored hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - Recommended a hybrid model that combines the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
   - Highlighted the potential benefits of leveraging both user-item interactions and content features.

## Business Understanding

### Objective:
The primary objective of the recommender system project is to enhance user satisfaction and engagement on the MovieLens platform by delivering personalized and relevant movie recommendations. The recommender system aims to provide users with tailored suggestions based on their historical movie ratings and tagging activities, ultimately improving their overall experience.

### Scope:
The project focuses on implementing a collaborative filtering-based recommender system, leveraging the ml-latest-small dataset from MovieLens. The recommendations are centered around user preferences, ensuring that users discover movies aligned with their tastes and interests. The scope includes both explicit ratings and user-generated tags as valuable indicators of user preferences.

### Success Criteria:
The success of the recommender system is evaluated based on several key performance indicators (KPIs):

#### User Engagement:
- Increase in the number of user interactions with the platform, including ratings, tags, and time spent on the website.

#### Recommendation Accuracy:
- Improvement in the precision and relevance of movie recommendations, reducing instances of irrelevant or disliked suggestions.

#### User Satisfaction:
- Positive feedback from users, measured through surveys, reviews, and user ratings.

#### Platform Adoption:
- Growth in the number of registered users and active users leveraging the recommendation features.

## Data Understanding

### Data Source:
The dataset (ml-latest-small) consists of 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies. The data were generated by 610 users between March 29, 1996, and September 24, 2018.

The data used in this project is pulled from four different separate files:

#### 1. Movies Data (movies.csv):
Contains movie information, including titles and genres.

**Columns:**
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `title`: The title of the movie, which also includes the year of release in parentheses.
- `genres`: A pipe-separated list of genres to categorize the movie (e.g., Action|Adventure|Comedy).

#### 2. Links Data (links.csv):
Provides identifiers for linking to external movie-related sources (IMDb, TMDb).

**Columns:**
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie, consistent with other data files.
- `imdbId`: Identifier for movies used by IMDb (Internet Movie Database).
- `tmdbId`: Identifier for movies used by TMDb (The Movie Database).

#### 3. Ratings Data (ratings.csv):
Each entry represents a user's rating for a specific movie. Contains user ratings on a 5-star scale for movies.

**Columns:**
- `userId`: ID representing the unique identifier for each user.
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `rating`: User's rating for the movie on a 5-star scale with half-star increments (0.5 to 5.0).
- `timestamp`: The timestamp when the rating was recorded, represented in seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

#### 4. Tags Data (tags.csv):
Contains user-generated metadata (tags) about movies.

**Columns:**
- `userId`: ID representing the unique identifier for each user.
- `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `tag`: User-generated metadata describing a movie, typically a single word or short phrase.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp when the tag was applied, represented in seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
