    "### Project Overview\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that provides users with a list of the top 5 movie recommendations based on their previous ratings. By analyzing user preferences and movie ratings, the model will suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy, helping them discover new content based on their viewing history therefore addressing the problem of content overload users face on streaming platforms."

    "### Business Problem\n",
    "In the current entertainment industry where users are overwhelmed by the overabundance volume of available content,users often feel overwhelmed by the number of movie choices. Providing personalized movie recommendations is critical to ensuring users stay engaged and reduce time spent searching for the content. A well designed recommendation system helps solve this problem by analyzing user behavior and movie preferences, ultimately improving user satisfaction, increasing engagement with the platform and optimizing content discovery. This project will create a recommendation model using collaborative filtering, which suggests movies to users based on how similar their preferences are to other users."

    "The MovieLens dataset is consists of four separate files:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Ratings Data (`ratings.csv`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This dataset contains the primary information used to build the recommendation system with 100,000 rows and 4 columns Each row represents a user's rating for a specific movie, where:\n",
    "  - `userId`: Unique identifier for each user.\n",
    "  - `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.\n",
    "  - `rating`: Userâ€™s rating of the movie on a scale from 0.5 to 5.0 (in increments of 0.5).\n",
    "  - `timestamp`: The time when the rating was provided.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Movies Data (`movies.csv`)**\n",
    "- This dataset provides details on movies with 1,682 rows and 3 columns:\n",
    "  - `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie (matches the `movieId` in ratings).\n",
    "  - `title`: Name of the movie.\n",
    "  - `genres`: Movie genres (a movie can belong to multiple genres).\n",
    "\n",

    "  - `timestamp`: The time when the tag was provided.\n",
    "- Tags can provide additional insights into user perceptions, useful for hybrid or content-based recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Links Data (`links.csv`)**\n",
    "- This dataset links movies to external sources with 1,000 rows and 4 columns:\n",
    "  - `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie (matches `movieId` in ratings and movies datasets).\n",
