    "### Project Overview\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that provides users with a list of the top 5 movie recommendations based on their previous ratings. By analyzing user preferences and movie ratings, the model will suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy, helping them discover new content based on their viewing history therefore addressing the problem of content overload users face on streaming platforms."
